<h3>Project Background:</h3>
- During heavy rain, some streets in Metro Manila are flooded easily.
- One need to search social media channels to check if nearby streets are flooded or not (and are passable to light vehicles, cars).
- This project aims to bring flood information to a central Twitter account @MayBahaBa
- This project aims to collect data by means of crowd-sourced data using beacons worn by individuals and sensors strategically installed on streetlight (lamp) posts.
- Add-on to this project is TrapikPaBa, which aims to give real-time traffic situation related to flooding.
- This is an Open Community Project.
